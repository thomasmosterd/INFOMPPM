More precisely, we will look at the _TF-IDF_ metric, which stands for _Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency_, to produce our metrics which will allow us to measure and evaluate how important certain words are in documents that are part of our IMDb corpus. The \"texts\" or \"documents\" we will look at are 'plot' descriptions in the IMDb dataset. "

    "_Inverse Document Frequency_ is a metric that measures of important a term $t$ is in a given corpus (or collection) $D$ of documents $d_{i}$. While _Term Frequency_ measures the frequency of a term $t$ in a single document $d$, here _IDF_ consider frequency of a term $t$ over the whole corpus $D$ as to derive a weight on the statistical significance of term $t$ overall. The idea here is that common words which occur in many documents (\"man\" or a stop word like \"it\" for example) hold little importance overall as they are redundant. What _IDF_ does is to give more weight to words that are uncommon overall yet possibly significant for certain documents. This is the reason why the metric takes the $\\log$ of the fraction $\\frac{|D|}{|{d_{i} \\in D : t \\in d_{i}}|}$ where $|D|$ is the number of documents in corpus $D$ and $|{d_{i} \\in D : t \\in d_{i}}|$ is the number of times a term $t$ appears in a document in the corpus.
