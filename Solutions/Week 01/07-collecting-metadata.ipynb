    "# Collecting extra metadata\n",
    "In the coming weeks, you will refine this book recommender system. However, in order to do so, you need extra data. This part is not to keep you busy, though it takes some time and effort, but to make you think critically about the data you need to refine this recommender system. Luckily, for this assignment, retrieving this extra metadata is relatively easy. [Google APIs](https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:0451519841) offers a way to retrieve extra information based on an ISBN. "
